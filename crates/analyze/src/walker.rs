//! Template walker — produces the `TemplateSummary` from a parsed Fragment.
//!
//! Single AST walk that visits every node and dispatches to the relevant
//! collectors:
//!
//! - `use:` directives → register `__svn_action_attrs_N` in
//!   [`VoidRefRegistry`] (one per directive, counter shared workspace-wide
//!   per component).
//! - `bind:foo={getter, setter}` → register `__svn_bind_pair_N`.
//! - `bind:this={x}` where `x` is a simple identifier → record `x` as a
//!   bind-target. Emit later rewrites the matching `let x: T;` declaration
//!   in the script to `let x!: T;` so TypeScript's definite-assignment
//!   analysis doesn't flag closure reads (Svelte assigns asynchronously).
//! - Each block — counted; emit needs the count to generate unique loop
//!   binding names.
//!
//! This should ideally fuse with rune detection in a single visitor.
//! For now rune detection runs over the script AST (oxc) while template
//! walking is structural — different inputs, two passes. When we add a
//! `Visit` trait that bridges both, we'll fuse.
